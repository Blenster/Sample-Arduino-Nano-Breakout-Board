# Sample-Arduino-Nano-Breakout-Board
Sample KiCAD project used as a base for an intro to KiCAD class

This is not a real project and is designed, intentionally, to not do anything in particular. Instead it is just a way I can show folks how to do a couple of simple sample actions in their own projects such as connecting an LED or a switch using through-hole and surface mount parts. There is one "place through via" trace as well.
